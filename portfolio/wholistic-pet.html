					<p>As a freelance UX designer I worked with the team at Blue Kite Interactive to design the embroidery customization flow of their ecommerce site, and create a clickable prototype of the website.  The visual design decisions were determine by Blue Kite Interactive prior to me joining the project. </p>

						<p>To prepare for this design, I looked at what The Wholistic pet's competitors designed their embroidery customization flow. Specifically, I looked at SmartPak, Wholistic Pet's competitor, and Nike's shoe customization flow. I noted things that would work for this particular flow as well as things that would not work.  SmartPaks' embroidery customization </p>
						<p>Before jumping in to the design, I spoke with Blue Kite Interactive to determine what choices the user would have to make and how those choice affected future decisions. Hierarchy of choices, amount of choices, and - understanding the decisions that the user was presented with and how those affected their other choices.  This involved speaking with the client and working with the team. </p>

Ultimately I chose to go with a lightbox as that would recreate some of the immersive customization experience but would also stay connected to the product it was intended for. </p>

							<p>The first iteration of the design hid the secondary choices (color, placement etc.) until after the user chose the monogram vs. text selection first.  However, when I tested this, users wanted to see the entirety of their selection. </p>
							<p>I designed the customization flow to show users exactly what they would be getting and exactly what they would be deciding between. I incorporated a preview box that would change to reflect the user's selections so that users could see exactly what they were getting before paying for the customization. In addition to the preview box, I stayed away from dropdown selections and opted for slections that were more visually communicative. For example: choosing to put pictures of where the embroidery would go on the jacket as opposed to making this a drop down.  I wanted to ensure that users could make decisions with clarity which is easier to do when options are visual. </p>
							<p>The entirety of the prototype was built using Axure. </p>

						<p>If I were to continue this project or redo this project I would have liked to have spoken with end users.  Doing so would have given me a better idea of how to design this experience.  What makes users choose to add custom embroidery to their order? Do users customize for self expression, for utilitarian use?  I would also have liked to have user tested the wireframes before putting the prototype into Axure.  This would have helped to better inform my deicison to go with a lightbox rather than a different flow. </p>
